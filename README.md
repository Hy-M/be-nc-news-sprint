# Northcoders News API

[Link to project on Heroku ](https://nc-news-hym.herokuapp.com/api)

This api has many endpoints allowing access to northcoders news.

## Getting started

Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hy-M/be-nc-news-sprint

cd be-nc-news-sprint
```

Install the dependencies:

```
npm i
```

In the 'db' folder, create a file called credentials.js to store your psql credentials:

```
exports.username = "yourusername";
exports.password = "yourpassword";
```

Set up the development and test databases :
```
npm run setup-dbs
```

Seed the development database:
```
npm run seed
```

Run the app. It will run on http://localhost:9090
```
npm start
```

To view all of the available endpoints in JSON format, make a GET /api request. 

## Hosting

If you wish to host this app on Heroku, you will need to change some of the credentials code.

Install dotenv module:

```
npm i dotenv -D

```

This package will look for a '.env' file in root and store the variables on process.env.

In the root directory, create a '.env' file and store your psql credentials in this format:

```
username=yourusername
password=yourpassword
```

In knexfile.js, on the first line, destructure username and password from process.env along with DB_URL so it looks like this:

```
const { DB_URL, username, password } = process.env;
```

You will need to comment out or remove the code that is requiring 'username' and 'password' from db/credentials.js, as it will conflict with your new variables.

In listen.js:

```
const env = require("dotenv");
env.config()
```

Finally, you will need to go to Heroku in the browser.

Select your application -> Settings -> Config Vars -> Reveal Config Vars

Add key value pairs of your psql username and password, then push to Heroku as normal.
